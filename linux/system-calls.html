        <h1>Linux system calls</h1>
        <p>
          Programs usually interface with the kernel through libraries
          provided by the operating system, most commonly <code>libc</code>,
          Through these libraries, they have access to system functions.
          <abbr>POSIX</abbr>-compliant operating systems provide
          <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> and numerous others.
          Windows has the Win32 API and its many DLLs and functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These operating systems consist of strongly connected
          kernel and user space components, developed and distributed
          as one unit. The user space libraries are the only supported
          means of using the system. User space programs are not meant
          to talk to the kernel directly, they're meant to use the
          provided system libraries. This forces them to depend on and
          link against such libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is often possible to interface with the kernel
          directly, the kernel interface is unstable and subject
          to change. Software that insists on using that interface
          might simply stop working if or rather <em>when</em>
          it changes.
        </p>

            Then there's the whole "reinventing libc" insanity,
            even on macOS (where no such ABI stability was guaranteed,
            but they did it anyway, and that ended up with a macOS
            update breaking all Go apps).
            On Windows they can't get away with that,
            so they use Cgo instead

            As I understand it, Go currently has its own syscall
            wrappers for Darwin. This is explicitly against what
            Apple recommends, precisely because they're not willing
            to commit to a particular syscall ABI.
            This leads to issues like <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16570">#16570</a>,
            and although we've been lucky in that things have
            generally been backward-compatible so far, there's no
            guarantee that it'll continue to happen. It doesn't seem
            inconceivable to me that we'd at some point end up having
            to specify "build for macOS 10.13+" vs. "build for 10.12
            and below", for example.

        <p>
          Sometimes it's not even possible to use system calls at all.
          OpenBSD has implemented <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/">
          system call origin verification</a>, a security mechanism that
          only allows system calls originating from the system's <code>libc</code>.
          So not only is the kernel ABI unstable, normal programs are not even allowed
          to interface with the kernel at all.

            The eventual goal would be to disallow system calls from anywhere
            but the region mapped for libc, but the Go language port for OpenBSD
            currently makes system calls directly.

            Switching Go to use the libc wrappers (as is already done
            on Solaris and macOS) is something that De Raadt would like to see.
            It may allow dropping the main program text segment from the list of valid regions in the future:

        <h2>Linux is different</h2>
        <p>
          One of the things that make the Linux kernel interesting
          is the fact it has a stable kernel-userspace interface.
          Unlike virtually every other kernel and operating system,
          Linux guarantees stability at the binary interface level.

            This interface matches much of the POSIX interface
            and is based on it and other Unix based interfaces.
            It will only be added to over time,
            and not have things removed from it.

          This is rooted in the fact Linux is a <em>kernel</em>,
          not a complete operating system as traditionally defined.
          As an independent component, it <em>must</em> have a stable
          interface to user space software if anything is to be built
          upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          While many people argue that Linux is not an operating system,
          there's no question that Linux is a <em>platform</em> and that
          it is possible to safely build directly upon it. There is no
          actual <em>need</em> to depend on anything else.
          Not even <code>libc</code>.
